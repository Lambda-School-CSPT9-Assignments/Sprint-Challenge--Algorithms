#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) -  Time is linear as it will increase linealry with the size of the input data


b) O(n log n) - The outside loop is n; the inside look is log n, it's doubling with each iteration


c) O(n) - Time is linear as it will only do calls proportinate to the initial value for bunnies

## Exercise II
O(log n)

Determine the middle value of the number of floors, this cuts the amount of floors to test agains in half. If the egg breaks test the left side, if it doesn't test the left side. Each itneration will cut the amount in half.
